the metric is categorical accuracy 
The target is 80%
the reached accuracy is 65% 

The link to all the data/model_weights  is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5lKzZ8AI8_GmPnJPAxW8ssyt2wY1r75

as they are too big to be loaded on GitHub. 

Only the code is in GitHub without the data or the weights as they are in the drive

To run the code for Model_v4_training.ipynb it should load the Numpy datasets and the Model_v4.keras and be in the same folder.

The Numpy datasets and the Model_v4.keras are in the drive in the link above as well as the code. 

in the Github repo, only the code is available.

Python 3.10.12 was used.
